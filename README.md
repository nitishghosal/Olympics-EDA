# History of Olympics
As part this analysis I am exploring Summer Olympics medals data and would like to understand:
* Which Olympics had the most medals won?
* Which cities have hosted the games more than once?
* Which countries have won the most medals at the Summer Olympic games?
* Which athletes have won the most medals at the Summer Olympic games?
* Top 10 medal winning athletes
